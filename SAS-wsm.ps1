# SAS-wsm: Script to Start/Stop Windows Services and validate MidTier Readiness
# Version: 1.1.0
# Author: Andy Foreman
# Much of the baseline code derived from previous work by Greg Wootton on 20AUG2020
####
# Revision History
# 1.0.0 - 16 May 2022
# 1.0.1 - 22 August 2022. Add check on null arrays during webappserver log reading due to rolled logs.
# 1.1.0 - 15 September 2022. Change to external cfg file for service definitions. Add search, input checking and validation functions. Code revisions to support cfg file, etc.

# Get action and config file as arguments
param($action, $cfg)
