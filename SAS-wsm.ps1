# SAS-wsm: Script to Start/Stop Windows Services and validate MidTier Readiness
# Version: 2.0.0
# Author: Andy Foreman
# Much of the baseline code derived from previous work by Greg Wootton on 20AUG2020
# Special thanks to John Maxwell for auto-setup start/stop concept implemented in 2.0.0 on 12JUL2023.
####
# Revision History
# 1.0.0 - 16 May 2022
# 1.0.1 - 22 August 2022. Add check on null arrays during webappserver log reading due to rolled logs.
# 1.1.0 - 15 September 2022. Change to external cfg file for service definitions. Add search, input checking and validation functions. Code revisions to support cfg file, etc.
# 2.0.0 - 12 July 2023. Major revisions/rewrite. Merge with auto-setup start/stop script. Add supporting functions and parameters. Retain external cfg as optional support. Remove external cfg tester action.
# 2.1.0 - 29 May 2025. Added detailed audit logging

### GET USER INPUTS
# Get user-specified action as input
# $action = <start|stop|status> [required]
# $saslev = ....\SASConfig\LevN path. Used to verify WebAppServer startup. Script will attempt to determine this if not specified. Example: C:\SAS\Config\Lev1
# $cfg = Custom startup order configuration file. Default order is defined in this file and will be used if not specified.

	# This function could use improvement for theoretical efficiency. It is currently highly inefficient.
	# This function in reality completes in a fraction of a second, so the objective effort of changing it is probably not worthwhile.
	#
	# The current function could best be described as a selection sort mixed with a gnome sort? There is no logic to ignore already selected/sorted values.
	# Whenever a match is found, it is checked against the current output (sorted list). If already in the sorted list, it is treated the same as if there was no match at all.
	# The result is you check everything against everything else, but only allow it into the sorted list once, so in the end you have a sorted list of unique values.
	# You just do a lot of unnecessary checks to get there.
	#
	# THE BASIC LOGIC OF THIS FUNCTION AS IT STANDS IS AS FOLLOWS:
	# 1. Get the static list value #1 from position 0 of the array $StaticStartOrder, which is either user-defined (-cfg flag) or from a 'standard' order defined in this file.
	# 		> The example outlined here will reference define values used when checking the SAS Metadata Server
	# 2. Compare to the first value in the located list of services that contain 'SAS' ($GetSASServices).
	#	a.	If the user specified their own startup order configuraton, perform a literal check. 
	#			> Is "Metadata Server" = "randomserviceSAS" ?
	#			> No
	#	b.  If no startup order configuration was specified, perform a regex-based matching check referencing default startup order defined within this file.
	#		Examples past this step use literal ( = ), but regex match is very similar logically.
	#			> Is ".*Metadata Server" a regex match to "randomserviceSAS" ?
	#			> No
	# 3. Is "Metadata Server" = "SAS [Config-Lev1] Connect Spawner" ?
	#		> No
	# 4. Is "Metadata Server" = "SAS [Config-Lev1] SASMeta - Metadata Server" ?
	#		> Yes
	#		> Add "SAS [Config-Lev1] SASMeta - Metadata Server" to position 0 of list/array $StartOrder
	# 5. Is "Metadata Server" = "SAS [Config-Lev1] OLAP Server" ?
	#		> No
	# 6. Continue until checked all values we located on the machine that contain 'SAS' ($GetSASServices)
	# 7. Change static list value to the next position of the static list ($StaticStartOrder position 1). This is "Web Infrastructure Platform Data Server"
	# 8. Is "Web Infrastructure Platform Data Server" = "SAS [Config-Lev1] SASMeta - Metadata Server" ?
	#		> No
	# 9. Is "Web Infrastructure Platform Data Server" = "SAS [Config-Lev1] Web Infrastructure Platform Data Server" ?
	#		> Yes
	#		> Add "SAS [Config-Lev1] Web Infrastructure Platform Data Server" to position 1 of list/array $StartOrder
	# 10. Basically step 6 again. This all continues (7, 8, 9...) until we have looped through the entirety of $StaticStartOrder.
